My first issue was figuring out how to use the json property function, but research showed me the correct syntax and proceeeded. My only experience parsing json files is with python, the structure is the same, but the format was not.

forgot to add the Uri link, added that.

Had a few issues getting the forms to display correctly. It was an alignment issue in the form properties. 

Switched from a text box to a label since nothing would be changed by the user. 

I had some experience using forms in vba, this seemed kind of similar so i hope that its acceptable since its not a console app?.

I wasnt sure if we were using github so i just added all of this in at the last minute.
